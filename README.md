# Relationboat
Recently in the news there have been several stories about the fa√ßade of social media and how it affects mental health. Since people only publicize primarily positive aspects of their lives on social media, there is a huge skew in what is actually presented to everyone. After we heard about Microsoft's machine learning Emotion API as a part of Project Oxford and Indico.io (a text interpretting machine learning API), we knew we could combine the two into a test of how accurately social media depicts our friendships.

# What it does
After connecting to Facebook, Relationboat allows you to pick one of your friends, finds all of the pictures that the two of you are tagged in together, and parses all of your message history. It then determines how happy each of you are in the picture using Project Oxford and compares that to the positivity rating of your message history.
